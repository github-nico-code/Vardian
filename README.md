
VARDIAN - Windows PC virtual multi monitor viewer for Rokid Max

This software is still in alpha status. It is hosted at Vardian Github Page. Releases can be found at Vardian Github Releases Page.

Vardian is a program to use the Rokid Max device to look at a multi monitor setup for Windows PCs. It uses the 3DOF functionality to navigate a Window opened at the Rokid Max screen about the virtual windows monitors.

To add more virtual monitors to my setup without real monitors and without Admin access I take a HDMI dummy plug like One Dummy HDMI example device. An alternative approach can be virtual monitor drivers like IddSampleDriver.

I have taken some files from Monado for this project. Thanks for that.

I have taken some files from microsoft samples. Thanks for that.


What does this software do:

    Detect whether Rokid Max is connected.
    Move Rokid Max screen to the most right in Windows Virtual screen setup.
    Place a window at the Rokid Max screen.
    Copy Windows screen regions to the window at the Rokid Max screen.
    Move the copied screen region with the help of Rokid Max 3DOF functionality.

This program has some open TODOs. If you want to take over project or do some changes then please write me: nico.kasprzyk@gmx.de

Next steps could be:

    Implement a lot of comfort functionality
    Stability
    Use additional HID commands to get and set Rokid Max screen mode
