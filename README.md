This software is still in alpha status. Please take care. It is hosted at 
https://github.com/github-nico-code/Vardian

Vardian is a program to use the Rokid Max device to look at the windows screens. It uses the 
3DOF functionality to navigate the Rokid Max screen about the windows screen.

To extend Windows virtual screen without connecting an additional real monitor I take a
HDMI dummy plug like https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07YMTKJCR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1

I have taken some files from monado for this project 
(https://monado.pages.freedesktop.org/monado/index.html). Thanks for that.

I have taken some files from microsoft samples. Thanks for that.

What does this software do:
1. Detect whether Rokid Max is connected.
2. Move Rokid Max screen to the most right in Windows Virtual screen.
3. Place a window at the Rokid Max screen.
4. Copy screen regions to the Rokid Max screen.
5. Move the copied screen region with the help of Rokid Max 3DOF functionality.


This program has a lot of open TODOs. If you want to take over project or do some changes 
then please write me: nico.kasprzyk@gmx.de

Next steps from my side:
* Get the movements more smoothly.
* Implement a lot of comfort functionality.
* Stability.
